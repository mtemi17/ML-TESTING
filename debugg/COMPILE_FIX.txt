TROUBLESHOOTING COMPILATION ERRORS
===================================

The errors you're seeing reference old line numbers and variables that don't exist in the current file.
This indicates the MQL5 compiler is using cached/old code.

SOLUTION STEPS:
---------------
1. Close MetaEditor completely
2. Delete any .ex5 files in the MQL5/Experts folder
3. Reopen MetaEditor
4. Open the file: debugg/EA_CHARGER.mq5
5. Press F7 to compile

ALTERNATIVE: If errors persist
--------------------------------
1. In MetaEditor: Tools -> Options -> Compiler
2. Check "Clear cache before compilation"
3. Press F7 to compile

VERIFY CURRENT CODE:
--------------------
The current file should have:
- Line 274-275: ulong dealTicketId = 0; dealTicketId = (ulong)trans.deal;
- Line 295: ulong positionId = HistoryDealGetInteger(dealTicketId, DEAL_POSITION_ID);
- Line 304: long dealReasonCode = (long)HistoryDealGetInteger(dealTicketId, DEAL_REASON);
- Line 735: ulong ticketValue = trade.ResultTicket();

If you see different code, the file hasn't been saved or the compiler is using cache.
